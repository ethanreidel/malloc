# Free-list Malloc Implementation

My implementation of the C method malloc. I wanted to learn more about memory management under the hood so I decided to rewrite the existing memory allocation routine found in the C standard library. I ended up learning a lot about topics like fragmentation, coalescence and heap management. 

I'd definitely recommend this exercise to anyone interested in low level programming :)
