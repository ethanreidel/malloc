My implementation of the C method malloc. I was curious about the workings of memory management under the hood so I decided to rewrite the existing memory allocation found in the C standard library. I ended up learning a lot about topics like fragmentation, coalescence and heap management. Definitely recommend this exercise to anyone interested in low level programming :).
